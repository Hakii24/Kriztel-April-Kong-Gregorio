<p> &emsp; My name is <em><b>Kriztel April Kong Gregorio</b></em>,  I will be 22 on April 24. I was born in San Fernando, Pampanga and have lived there for over 15 years. We moved here in Pangasinan and currently residing at #2 Bolo, Labrador, Pangasinan. In elementary school, I attended <a href="../../../../../Working%20files/kriztelaprilgregorio/activity1_module2/2_GES%20GUAGUA%20ELEMENTARY%20SCHOOL.html">Guagua Elementary School</a>, then <a href="../../../../../Working%20files/kriztelaprilgregorio/activity1_module2/3_PHS%20PAMPANGA%20HIGH%20SCHOOL.html">Pampanga High School</a> from Grade 7 to Grade 10, then <a href="../../../../../Working%20files/kriztelaprilgregorio/activity1_module2/4_RMIS%20RAMON%20MAGSAYSAY%20INTEGRATED%20SCHOOL.html">Ramon Magsaysay Integrated School</a>in senior high, where I made many wonderful friends, and now I am enrolled at <a href="../../../../../Working%20files/kriztelaprilgregorio/activity1_module2/5_PSU%20PANGASINAN%20STATE%20UNIVERSITY.html">Pangasinan State University</a>, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor of Science in MathematicsÂ major in Computer Information Technology.
</p>
<p> &emsp; Back in elementary school, I was always in the top ten of my class. Mrs. Victorio, my grade 1 teacher, is the one I will never forget because she treated me as her daughter. Elementary school is a lot of fun and enjoyable. However, things changed in high school. My mother was sent to work abroad and faced numerous difficulties like financial difficulties, family issues, and bullying. I was bullied by our neighbors as well as at school. My senior year of high school was the worst time of my life. Then we came to Pangasinan and met some awesome people. I gained confidence and made some new friends. We're all busy with our studies now that I'm in college, but we still find time to hang out once in a while.</p>
<p> &emsp; The fact that I'm almost at the end of the School period makes me happy because it means I'll be able to help my mother earn money for my family and repay all of her sacrifices for us. I wanted to start my own business so that I could work for myself rather than for others. However, I need to work for others first to save enough money for my ambition hehe.</p>
